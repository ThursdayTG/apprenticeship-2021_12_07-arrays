# apprenticeship-2021_12_07-arrays - main branch
Now, this whole thing was, quite honestly, an absolute clusterfuck, at least for my current standards. There are several reasons for this.

The educational part, in which we were just introduced to arrays, was completely fine. When we were given our first tasks, however, I was very poorly prepared for the home-office test run that we did that day, so I ended up multi-tasking a lot and wasn't really focusing on the actual programming part (hence I will not upload these parts at all). And then my depression got bad enough to warrant a sick note. A week later after the official break for the holidays, I stayed a bit longer in school to catch up at least a bit on this topic, which is where the "task" part comes from here.

Unfortunately, as of 2022-01-31, I have not actually gotten into and practiced with arrays sufficiently to understand them properly, so I have yet to repeat that process. I hope it won't take too long for me to start a project, be it for leaisure or in the context of my apprenticeship, in which I will have to deal with arrays more thoroughly than I did so far.

I put the "edu" & "task" parts in two separate branches and won't post any releases, and instead I just upload all the files to the branches and let that be it. If viewing older builds is desired, of course Git stores the differences between all commits, so this is not an issue. I simply have no idea how else to manage this properly at this point.
